# Fate Campaign

**Planetary Readiness, Intelligence, and Strategic Monitoring (PRISM)**

A tabletop RPG campaign using **Fate Condensed** set in a 1960s retro-futuristic alternate history.

## Overview

Players are operatives within **PRISM**, a mysterious global organization dedicated to protecting the world from genuine threats: rogue dictators, weaponized corporations, mad scientists, and unexplained phenomena.

The campaign emphasizes collaborative world-building, where the organization's true nature unfolds through play. Nothing is predetermined—player agency shapes what PRISM becomes.

## Getting Started

Start with **AGENTS.md** — it's the entry point for understanding the campaign, the world, and how the project is organized.

## Project Structure

- **AGENTS.md** — Campaign overview, setting, organization structure, and navigation guide
- **canon/** — Confirmed game facts (world, characters, session narratives)
- **explorations/** — Ideas under consideration, brainstorms, "what if" thinking
- **sessions/** — Raw session notes and cleaned-up narrative recaps

## Canon vs. Explorations

- **Canon** = What's actually part of the game world
- **Explorations** = Active brainstorming and idea development

When an idea moves to canon, it's removed from explorations to keep thinking clear and focused.

## For AI Assistants

If you're Claude or another AI assistant helping run this campaign, read AGENTS.md first to understand:
1. What has been established (canon)
2. What's being explored (explorations)
3. How to navigate the project
4. The tone, setting, and themes
