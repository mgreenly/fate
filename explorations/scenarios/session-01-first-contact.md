# Session 1: First Contact - Exploration Notes

## Status
Brainstorming in progress - not yet finalized

## Overview
The first session where players meet each other and encounter the antagonist for the first time. Designed to:
- Start with immediate action
- Introduce players to each other during the scenario
- Establish the antagonist as sophisticated and morally complex
- Hint at PRISM's compromised security from the start
- Create a recurring minor villain (exosuit user)
- Set up multiple mysteries

## Player Handout (Pre-Character Creation)

### Draft Structure - Single Page

**Campaign Pitch Section:**
- 1960s retro-futuristic setting (2-3 sentences painting the picture)
- Players are operatives in PRISM
- Pulpy action-adventure with real stakes

**What You Know About PRISM:**
- Planetary Readiness, Intelligence, and Strategic Monitoring
- Global organization protecting against genuine threats
- Compartmentalized - you don't know much yet
- You've been recruited, vetted, given basic training
- You're about to join a field team

**Your Situation:**
- Recently completed training
- Met your handler briefly
- Currently in [LOCATION - wherever first scenario is]
- About to receive your first real assignment

**Character Creation Notes:**
- Skills that fit: espionage, investigation, combat, science, social
- Tone: exceptional but human, not superhuman
- Think: competent, equipped, maybe a bit lucky
- High concept should reflect why PRISM recruited you

**Session 1 Expectations:**
- You'll meet your teammates for the first time
- The action starts immediately
- No lengthy introductions - reveal yourselves through play

## The First Scenario: "Closest Assets"

### The Hook

**The Call:**
Players are all within 15-20 minutes of the same location (different reasons - assignment, leave, living there, transit). Handler contacts each separately:
> "Closest available asset to [LOCATION]. Low-level courier missed check-in. Verify status, secure package if necessary. Other assets converging. You're a team now."

**Key line:** "You're a team now" - matter-of-fact, no ceremony, very PRISM

### Location Sequence

1. **Technology Expo** - Primary scene, the altercation happens here
2. **Airport** - Chase/escape sequence
3. **Luxury Hotel** - Investigation aftermath

### The Players

**The Defecting Scientist:**
- From restrictive nation (Soviet bloc or similar)
- Brilliant engineer/scientist
- Created prototype exoskeleton (on display at expo)
- Wants to defect, has complete specifications on microfilm
- Desperate for extraction

**The Third Party (Double-Crossers):**
- Promised to extract the scientist
- Really just want the technology
- Scientist is disposable to them
- Corporate agents? PMC? Criminal organization? (TBD)
- Planned to grab both scientist and prototype

**The Antagonist:**
- Learned about the double-cross **via PRISM leaks** (establishes compromise immediately)
- There for his own purposes (the microfilm)
- Has resources, planning, goons
- Professional and sophisticated

**PRISM Operatives (Players):**
- Sent to check on missing courier
- Arrive during or just after the altercation
- Multiple factions already engaged

### Act 1: The Technology Expo

**What Players Find:**
- PRISM courier wounded, dying, or hiding
- "I followed him... the exchange... he's here, he's HERE..."
- Courier has photos/documents showing the antagonist
- Dies or passes out before explaining everything

**The Altercation:**
- Third party moves on the scientist and the exosuit display
- Antagonist intervenes (for the microfilm)
- Physical confrontation using the prototype exosuit
- NOT a gunfight - altercation with experimental technology
- Someone uses/activates the exosuit (antagonist? third party? scientist in panic?)
- Dramatic moment: tears through jacket/clothing to reveal the suit
- **Caught on TV news cameras** - public, televised, spectacular

**The Chaos:**
- Exosuit causes structural damage to expo pavilions
- Civilians fleeing, injured, in danger
- Very loud, very public, very dramatic
- Multiple factions fighting

**Split Outcomes:**
- **Antagonist secures:** The microfilm (complete specifications)
- **Third Party secures:** Physical prototype exosuit (bulky, obvious)
- **The Scientist:** Killed? Captured? Escapes? (TBD)
- **Both factions:** Have goons providing cover/rear guard

**Players Arrive:**
- Middle or tail end of the chaos
- Multiple factions fleeing different directions
- Goons from BOTH sides still present
- Civilians need help
- Courier's last words: *"There were... three groups... he KNEW they'd be here..."*

**Player Choices:**
- Pursue the antagonist?
- Pursue third party?
- Save civilians/prevent casualties?
- Secure the courier?
- Interrogate goons?
- All of the above (split party)?

### Act 2: The Airport Chase

**The Antagonist's Escape:**
- Clean, professional extraction to airport
- Private or commercial flight (retro-futuristic jet aesthetic)
- **His goons buy him time** - rear guard action
- Gets away with the microfilm
- Leaves goons behind (expendable, captured, or killed)

**Third Party Escape:**
- Also heading to airport (or alternate extraction point)
- Carrying bulky exosuit prototype (harder to conceal)
- Messier escape than antagonist
- May be catchable if players pursue immediately

**Airport Scene:**
- Goons from one or both factions still present
- Possible confrontation with hired muscle
- They know NOTHING (paid to delay, hired through cutouts)
- Players arrive to see antagonist's plane departing
- **First clear look at antagonist's face** - maybe a knowing smile

**The Trade-off:**
- If players saved civilians at expo: antagonist is long gone, but lives were saved
- If players pursued immediately: face goons, maybe catch some, antagonist still escapes professionally

### Act 3: The Hotel Investigation

**Location:**
- Luxury hotel where antagonist stayed (tracked via courier intel, witnesses, or PRISM investigation)
- Retro-futuristic swank aesthetic

**What They Find:**
- Antagonist checked out (normally or controlled hurry)
- Professional tradecraft (paid cash, false name)
- But he left something (intentional or oversight?):
  - Notes about PRISM (operational details he shouldn't know)
  - Corporate letterhead, business cards
  - Technical documents related to the exchange
  - **Evidence he was a PRISM operative once** (recognizes protocols, old equipment, cryptic note)

**The Hook:**
- Evidence suggests deep PRISM knowledge
- Hints at his past with the organization
- Parting message? *"Tell them the Monitor is watching"* or similar cryptic reference
- Players realize: this isn't random, he's connected to PRISM's past

### The Leverage Situation

**What the Antagonist Has:**
- Complete microfilm specifications of the exosuit
- Design weaknesses, limitations
- Possibly: killswitch, tracking protocols
- Knowledge of who the third party is

**What Third Party Has:**
- Physical prototype exosuit
- Incomplete understanding of how it works
- Limited ability to replicate or modify

**The Leverage:**
Antagonist can:
- Blackmail them (knows who they are, has proof of theft)
- Sell them the specs (at his price)
- Counter the suit in future conflicts (knows weaknesses)
- Track the suit (if specs include telemetry)
- Expose them to authorities or rivals
- Give intel to PRISM as a "gift" (proving he's steps ahead)

### The Exosuit Villain - Future Sessions

**Session 2-3 Appearance:**
- Someone from third party uses the exosuit
- Becomes minor recurring "super villain"
- Corporate enforcer? Mercenary? Criminal?
- Uses it for: robberies, enforcement, attacks
- Tough fight (players don't know weaknesses yet)
- Escapes or is driven off

**Later Resolution:**
Antagonist uses his leverage:
- Sells third party out (to government, rival corp, maybe PRISM)
- Gives players the weakness (anonymous tip proving he's in control)
- Buys them off (they work for him now)
- Destroys them (demonstrates reach and ruthlessness)

**Purpose:**
- Shows antagonist plays long games
- He's strategic, not just reactive
- The exosuit villain was always a pawn
- Demonstrates his resources and patience

## Key Themes Established

### Immediate Questions
1. Multiple factions want advanced technology
2. The antagonist knew about the double-cross beforehand (how?)
3. PRISM might be compromised (courier hints, antagonist's knowledge)
4. The antagonist is sophisticated - planned, resourced, informed
5. Moral ambiguity: Did he save the scientist or steal him? Let third party have the suit - why?

### Session 1 Reveals
- **Compartmentalization is real:** Players are closest assets, thrown together
- **PRISM has leaks:** Antagonist knew things he shouldn't
- **Technology is dangerous:** The exosuit creates real chaos
- **Multiple threats exist:** Third party, antagonist, both distinct
- **The antagonist is complex:** Not a simple villain, has his own agenda
- **Public exposure:** TV footage means consequences and complications

## Open Questions to Resolve

### About the Scientist
- [ ] What happens to them? Killed, captured, escapes, taken by antagonist?
- [ ] What nation are they from?
- [ ] What else do they know besides exosuit specs?

### About Third Party
- [ ] Who are they exactly? Corporation, PMC, intelligence service, criminals?
- [ ] How do they fit into larger campaign threats?
- [ ] Who specifically uses the exosuit when they return?

### About the Exosuit
- [ ] What's it designed for? Industrial, military, rescue, combination?
- [ ] How bulky/refined is it? 1960s aesthetic (clunky but powerful)?
- [ ] What are its limitations that antagonist knows about?

### About PRISM Leak
- [ ] How is it revealed to players?
- [ ] Is it a mole, hacked systems, social engineering?
- [ ] Does the handler know? How do they react?

### About the Antagonist
- [ ] Is his face clearly caught on TV cameras?
- [ ] Does he speak to players during the chaos?
- [ ] What exactly does he leave at the hotel?

### About Location
- [ ] What city/country is this expo in?
- [ ] What's the expo called? "Technology of Tomorrow"? "World's Fair"?
- [ ] What other displays are there besides the exosuit?

## Design Notes

### Why This Works
- **Action starts immediately:** No slow buildup, players dive in
- **Characters revealed through choices:** Not backstory dumps, but actions under pressure
- **Fate-friendly:** Aspects established through scene, compels and invokes natural
- **Multiple mysteries:** PRISM leak, antagonist's past, third party identity, scientist's fate
- **Moral complexity:** Antagonist might have done something good (saving scientist from double-cross)
- **Recurring elements:** Exosuit villain returns, leverage plays out over sessions
- **Retro-futuristic aesthetic:** TV cameras, microfilm, expo, exosuit design all very 1960s

### Player Agency
Multiple decision points:
- Pursue antagonist vs save civilians
- Which faction to focus on
- How to handle goons (fight, interrogate, let go)
- Investigation approach at hotel
- How they introduce themselves to each other during chaos

### Tone Established
- Pulpy action (exosuit fight)
- Real danger (civilians at risk, courier dies)
- Espionage (multiple factions, tradecraft, leaks)
- Mystery (antagonist's past, PRISM compromise)
- Moral ambiguity (who's the real villain here?)
