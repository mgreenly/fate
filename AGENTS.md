# AGENTS.md - Fate Condensed Campaign

## Overview

This is a tabletop RPG campaign using **Fate Condensed** rules. We are building a world together collaboratively through play—the story emerges from player decisions and discoveries over many sessions.

**Campaign Title:** (To be determined)

**System:** Fate Condensed

**Players:**
- Eric
- Ashley
- Quinn
- Keith

## Setting

### Time Period & Aesthetic
**1960s Retro-Futuristic Alternate History**

Imagine what people in 1945 thought the world would look like in 1960. Chrome and sleek lines. Flying cars that *almost* work. Atomic design everywhere. The world is cinematic, stylish, a bit campy—but with real stakes underneath.

### Core Premise

Players are operatives in **PRISM**, a mysterious, compartmentalized global organization dedicated to protecting the world from genuine existential threats. The organization is far from simple:

- Operatives exist on both sides of the Iron Curtain but don't necessarily trust each other
- Most agents don't know what they don't know—knowledge is compartmentalized
- Even handlers and leadership may be unaware of the full picture
- The organization's true goals and structure remain mysterious, even to those within it

The Cold War exists as backdrop and complication (travel restrictions, hidden locations, lack of cooperation between governments), but it is **not** the main story. Real threats cut across political lines.

### Tone

**Pulpy.** Action-adventure with espionage flavor. Heroes are exceptional but not superhuman—they're skilled, well-equipped, perhaps lucky, but they bleed like anyone else. Think *Man from U.N.C.L.E.* with genuine danger.

## Key Threats

The world faces danger from multiple vectors:

- **Rogue Dictators** - Autocratic leaders with resources and ambition
- **Evil Corporations** - Mega-corporations willing to weaponize anything for profit
- **Mad Scientists** - Brilliant, dangerous minds escaping from various conflicts (WWII, Korean War, others) with their own agendas
- **UFOs** - Unconfirmed sightings and unexplained phenomena, inspiration from TV series *UFO*—mysterious, not clearly explained, unnerving

Science is used for evil far more often than the supernatural appears. When the strange does emerge, it's subtle and rare.

## The Organization: PRISM

Planetary Readiness, Intelligence, and Strategic Monitoring

What does PRISM actually stand for? Different people believe different things. The mystery is intentional.

### Structure
- Compartmentalized into layers
- Operatives often don't know the full scope of the organization
- Handlers operate with limited information
- Leadership may not know what agents in the field discover
- Operatives exist on both sides of the Iron Curtain

### The Mystery
PRISM's true goals, complete structure, and purpose are unknown—even to many within it. Understanding what PRISM really *is* will be a slow revelation over many sessions.

## The Antagonist

A **disillusioned former operative** serves as a recurring antagonist:

- Renaissance man: exceptional at martial arts, medicine, science
- Super-fit and exceptionally skilled, but explicitly *not* superhuman
- Wealthy: CEO of a major corporation with multiple shell companies
- **Key trait:** He knows something about PRISM's true goals that drove him away
- **His role:** Appears in early sessions, escapes, hints at knowledge about the organization that makes players question everything

## Campaign Progression

### Early Sessions
Players encounter the antagonist and get their first tantalizing clue about PRISM's deeper nature. He escapes—but his parting words plant seeds.

### Ongoing
The organization's mystery unfolds through:
- Player questions and investigations
- Discoveries made during missions
- Encounters with operatives from other divisions
- Revelations about compartmentalization (e.g., learning there's a China department, *then* learning there's an Eastern European department)

Player agency shapes what PRISM becomes. The organization's true nature will be revealed through sessions, not predetermined.

## Project Navigation

### Canon (Established Game Facts)
Everything in `/canon/` is confirmed as part of the game world.

- **canon/world/** - Established setting details, locations, confirmed organizations
- **canon/characters/** - Player character details, established NPCs, confirmed antagonist
- **canon/sessions/** - Narrative recaps of sessions that have been played

### Explorations (Ideas Under Consideration)
Everything in `/explorations/` is brainstorming, idea exploration, or "what if" thinking. These are *not* part of the game world yet.

- **explorations/world/** - Location ideas, threat brainstorms, world questions
- **explorations/characters/** - NPC possibilities, character arc ideas
- **explorations/scenarios/** - Mission brainstorms, plot thread ideas
- **explorations/mechanics/** - Rules interpretations being considered

**Important:** When an idea moves from explorations to canon, it is removed from explorations. Explorations should only contain *current* active thinking.

### Sessions (Play Records)
- **sessions/live/** - Raw notes during or immediately after play
- **sessions/narratives/** - Cleaned-up, narrative recaps distilled from live notes

## How to Use This File

When starting a session, I will:
1. Read AGENTS.md first
2. Review canon files to understand what's confirmed
3. Check explorations to see what's being considered
4. Review session narratives for context on what has happened
5. Use session live notes if needed for detailed reference

This file acts as the entry point and map for the entire project.

## Current Status

- **Setting:** Established
- **Organization (PRISM):** Established
- **Players:** Named (characters to be created)
- **Antagonist:** Concept established (name and corporation details TBD)
- **Ready to:** Create player characters and begin play
